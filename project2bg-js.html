Although we share the same family name, I am not in any way
related to the famous (or is it infamous) adventurer, Bilbo.
I have a lovely wife, Elvira, and two grown children, Max
and Miriam. Max has chosen to follow me in my profession,
which is described below. Miriam is a beekeeper for the town
bookkeeper, who keeps bees as a second job.

I am employed by Forest Keepers, Limited. My job, as I understand
it, is to keep an eye on the 4 acres of wild cranberries that
grow in the swamp at the edge of the village forest. I am required
to file a daily report, in triplicate, on the condition of the
cranberry bushes. To accomplish my task, I walk by and inspect
every cranberry bush in the swamp every workday. My employer provides
me with wading boots for my job. I pick up the boots at the office
every weekday morning and turn them back in, after a thorough
cleaning, after each workday.
